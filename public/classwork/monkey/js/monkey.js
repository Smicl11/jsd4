/*Work with a partner to create a monkey object, which has the following properties:

* name
* species
* foodsEaten

And the following methods:
* eatSomething(thingAsString)
* introduce: producers a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it's eaten.

Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set and methods defined.

Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes
for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).
